ðŸ§  Data Science & Python Project Repository
This repository contains my coursework and assignment project 1 for the STQD6014 subject. The project demonstrates core programming concepts and data handling using Python, organized into five parts:

ðŸ“˜ Part 1: Introduction to Data Science & Algorithms
Covers the basics of data science, roles of a data scientist, and algorithm design. Includes a custom real-world scenario, algorithm breakdown, and design tools such as flowchart, pseudocode, and hierarchy chart.

ðŸ›’ Part 2: Lists, Dictionaries & Looping â€“ Inventory Management System
Implements a product price management system using loops and dictionaries. The system allows adding, updating, viewing products, and handles invalid input with a continuous menu.

ðŸ”§ Part 3: Functions & Classes
Presents a scenario using Python classes with inheritance and functions. Includes class-based module creation, instance testing, and explanation with a final conclusion.

ðŸ“‚ Part 4: Files & Exceptions
Demonstrates reading/writing from text files and handling exceptions. Also includes storing user input using the JSON module, and handling FileNotFoundError.

ðŸ”¢ Part 5: NumPy Arrays & Operations
Generates ten arrays of various sizes using NumPy. Performs 20+ operations including single-array processing, same-size array operations, and cross-size operations like dot product, based on references from Python for Data Analysis.
